# Programming-Final-Project
# For starters, I am in the animation and games concentration at UTD. So, for this project I wanted to create the game Minesweeper using python since it is related to my concentration. The goal of this project is to have a functioning Mindsweeper game that you can play. It should be able to ask the player how many mines they want to add as well as indicate how many mines are around the area that the player selects.
